## AI and Copyright â€” What We Know So Far

The U.S. Copyright Office recently published an in-depth report on the copyrightability of AI-generated works. The report highlights that:

- Copyright protection generally requires human authorship.
- Works generated entirely by AI without meaningful human authorship are unlikely to qualify for copyright.
- This creates uncertainty for code or creative works produced with AI assistance.
- Legal frameworks are still evolving, and this license embraces that uncertainty by allowing free reuse without claiming ownership.
